If you want to make it executable just use this command
'pip install pyinstaller' (make sure you have python installed)

then run pyinstaller by typing 'pyinstaller --onefile organize.py' #this will make your file executable
this will make organize.py a executable file with all its dependencies 

then simply run it like an application.
